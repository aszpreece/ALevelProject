        //DIARY
            //Day 1: Started on initial noise implementation (it failed)
            //Day 2: Made a little more progress but still not quite right
            //Day 3: Finally got some noise going
            //       Started on creating island algorithm and came up with a good prototype
            //Day 4: Decided to tweak algorithm so islands were contained within the screen.
            //       Came up with better gradient equation
            //       Changed layered noise algorithm
            //       Changed perlin function to take a scale value 
            //       Finalised island tech demo
            //Day 5: Started on actual game
            //       Came up with storage solution for level
            //Day 6: Character created with accleration based movement
            //Day 7: Entities are now all rendered using one method allowing for more than one entity to exist. Previously this was not possible due to some poor coding
            //       The player can no longer go through walls and will bounce off them
            //       The player will go slower in water
			//       Added a procedurally generated grass texture
